# The Reminder

The inspiration for this project came from an incident that happened while I was working for Team Liquid. The team was competing in a lot of tournaments at the time, and some of the players had trouble remembering when and what they needed to do prior to the events. In an effort to streamline the process, I whipped up a quick python script that would email the guys the day before a tournament. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Dependent Libraries

First install - TinyDB

```
pip install tinydb
```

Next Install - Yagmail

```

```
### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
