# The Reminder

The inspiration for this project came from an incident that happened while I was working for Team Liquid. The team was competing in a lot of tournaments at the time, and some of the players had trouble remembering when and what they needed to do prior to the events. In an effort to streamline the process, I whipped up a quick python script that would email the guys the day before a tournament. 

## Getting Started
